		<p>Ralph was the sweetest and most kindest man that I've ever known.
		He loved his family. He talked with his brother, Don, and sister-in-law, Judy, every Friday evening at 7pm religiously.
		Ralph also took to my family as his own and we all loved him just as as if he were blood.
		He cared about any person in his life more than himself. Even people he had just met or didn't even know. He was very selfless and loved to help others any way that he could.</p>
		
		<p>	As Ralph always said, he was a <u>doer</u> and didn't like to sit still. He loved to tinker with and fix things. He's probably kept the television antenna business going with all of his purchases.</p>
		He will be sorely missed by every one that he touched in his life. I hope that he is at peace chatting every one up and running around all of the Home Depots in the sky.</p>

		<p>Ralph of course had the one love of his life, Kathy. He has been reunited with her as he requested.</p>
		
		<p>I love you Ralph and I hope to see you again some day.
